# CPUs are smart <span class="text-green-500">**dumb**</span> things

How can we ever be memory safe if everything is just a CPU instruction?

<!--
If an instruction is: "Load value from memory into register X", how could we ever make that secure?

We need an example application. How does this work in "reality"

## Hello Memory!

```rust{all|3|4|6-8|10-12|13|all|4|7|11}
const ARR_LEN: usize = 10;

pub fn main() {
    let mut array = vec![0; ARR_LEN];

    for (i, v) in array.iter_mut().enumerate() {
        *v = i * 2;
    }

    for v in array.iter() {
        println!("{}", v);
    }
}
```

<!--
Let's take an example, and see what it does

Our app:
- declares some dynamic memory for an array
- fills that array with the index * 2
- prints each item in that array (backwards)
- cleans up the app (freeing the memory, and exiting)

But:
- How does memory allocation even?
- What is printf even printing to? What is STDOUT?
- free the memory? free it back to what/whom?

Answers: Thank you libraries!

## Hello Memory! (with less secrets)

```rust{all|1|3-7|7,12-13}
#![no_std]

extern crate std;
use std::io;
use std::io::prelude::*;
use std::string::ToString;
use std::vec::Vec;

const ARR_LEN: usize = 10;

pub fn main() {
    let mut array: Vec<usize> = Vec::with_capacity(ARR_LEN);
    array.resize(ARR_LEN, 0);

    for (i, v) in array.iter_mut().enumerate() {
        *v = i * 2;
    }

    for v in array.iter() {
        io::stdout().write(&v.to_string().as_bytes()).unwrap();
        io::stdout().write(&[10]).unwrap();
    }
}
```

<!--
- Removing the macros uncovers the truth
- Note: Not all of this is "true"**
- By removing the std crate, we will see everything we need
- e.g. we need to bring in std, and import everything we need
- Our vector is just a resized vector
- Our output is writing byte streams to stdout

## How does `Global.alloc` even?

[From the docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/alloc/alloc/trait.Allocator.html#tymethod.allocate)

<blockquote>

```rust
fn allocate(&self, layout: Layout) -> Result<NonNull<[u8]>, AllocError>
```

Attempts to allocate a block of memory.

On success, returns a NonNull<[u8]> meeting the size and alignment guarantees of layout.

The returned block may have a larger size than specified by layout.size(), and may or may not have its contents initialized.

## But really

_Attempts to allocate a block of memory_

A.K.A: Malloc and Friends!*

<v-click>

<hr class="mt-3 mb-3">

### And an over simplification:

</v-click>

<v-clicks>

<p>

`Your code` "Hey `malloc`, give me some some memory"

</p>

<p>

`Malloc` .oO ( I seem to be fresh out of spare memory )

</p>

<p>

`Malloc` "Hey `<system>` can I have some memory?" `mmap|brk`

</p>

<p>
 
`System` "Sure just be sure to return it later" `#deadbeef`

</p>

<p>

`Malloc` "Hey code have some memory" `&ptr`

</p>

<p>

`Your code` "Cool"

</p>

</v-clicks>

<footer>
 <sup>* There are so many extra asterisks here</sup>
</footer>

<!--
What this all means:
- Our code talks with libraries that talks to malloc
- Malloc talks to our system, and gets memory and manages it for us
-->

---

## BUT WHY DOES THIS MATTER?

Code = Assembly = Machine Instructions = Control the Computron... Right?

<v-click>

Well.. sort of yes, sort of no.

</v-click>

<v-click>

```mermaid {theme: 'dark', scale: 0.7}
sequenceDiagram
  participant C as code.rs
  participant L as std::alloc
  participant K as kernel
  participant M as Computron 3000

  C->>L: Vec::new()
  rect rgb(33, 33, 33)
  note over L: Black Magic
  L->>K: mmap [syscall]
  K->>M: mov|jump|etc
  M->>K: mov|jump|things
  K->>L: 0xdeadbeef (ptr)
  end
  L->>C: Vec<T>
```

</v-click>

<!--
- Kernels/System APIs are generally always in the middle
- Kernels and systems make sure things like multitasking can happen, drivers work, all that cool stuff
- Our code is interacting a lot with kernels, we never directly get memory ourselves.

Why is this relevant? Because compilers compile to a target. In linux, malloc will do sys calls.
In web assembly.....???

The full path:
- application calls malloc
- library implements malloc to use syscalls
- sys call returns some memory address to library
- the library manages that block of memory
- Our code manages that block
-->

## Summary

<div class="py-4">

> Rewind: How does assembly Even?

</div>

<v-clicks>

<p>

**Q: What is assembly?**

_A: It's a human readable verison of machine instructions to control our CPU_

</p>

<p>

<hr>

Q: How is this eventually safe (e.g memory)?

_A: `syscall`s and trusting the kernel to manage it_

</p>

<p>

<hr>

Q: But how does our code know to use those `syscall`s / Aren't they target specific?

_A: Libraries! Libraries everywhere, and YES_

</p>

</v-clicks>

<!--
We started talking about assembly, and how does that work. We moved to how we allocate memory, why does this matter?
We the last slide we see std::alloc is talking to our system (a kernel in this case).
e.g. sometimes we are just talking to a kernel instead of talking to the cpu directly.

-->

---

## But before we move on, some fun things (AKA headaches)

Did you know?

<v-clicks>

- You can write your own malloc/allocator
- Rust was using jemalloc everywhere until 2018 when it started to use the "system provided allocator"
- It would be fun, but you probably shouldn't think about doing this

</v-clicks>

# Hello WASM

```rust{0|all}
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn add1(i: i32) -> i32 {
    i + 1
}
```

```js{0|1-11|12-17}
let adder;
async function init() {
  const { instance } =

Description:
- We have a page
- We click a button, the counter goes up
- But it's controlled through this C code instead! (well the adding is)

And this is the JS that's driving it:
- We load the wasm file, and assign our adder
- Then on every button click, we get the value of the box, and set it to the result of our added

## Where did `add1.wasm` come from?

// add1.rs
#![no_std]

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn add1(i: i32) -> i32 {
    i + 1
}

#[panic_handler]
fn panic(_panic: &core::panic::PanicInfo<'_>) -> ! {
    loop {}
}
```

And some compilation:
```sh
rustc --target wasm32-unknown-unknown \
  -Copt-level=3 \
  -Clto \
  add1.rs
```

`wasm2wat add1.wasm`

```wasm{0|all|3-6}
(module
  (type (;0;) (func (param i32) (result i32)))
  (func $add1 (type 0) (param i32) (result i32)
    local.get 0
    i32.const 1
    i32.add)
  (memory (;0;) 16)
  (global $__stack_pointer (mut i32) (i32.const 1048576))
  (global (;1;) i32 (i32.const 1048576))
  (global (;2;) i32 (i32.const 1048576))
  (export "memory" (memory 0))
  (export "add1" (func $add1))
  (export "__data_end" (global 1))
  (export "__heap_base" (global 2)))
```

  (export "__heap_base" (global 2)))

<v-clicks>

- Assembly: we were making syscalls for malloc
- WASM: we have access to these variables which define the size/location of our stack/heap

## `#![no_std]` and WASM

Rust's stdlib is super powerful, but they might be lacking support in WASM:

<v-clicks>

- `std::fs::File` - read/write files
- `std::path` - cross platform file paths
- `std::net` - relied upon by `http`, `reqwest`
- `std::thread` - spawning threads
- `std::ffi` - interface all those other shared libs

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

<hr v-click class="my-6">

Alternatives:

</v-click>

<v-clicks>

- Use the parts of `std` or `core` that do work in WASM (e.g. `std::alloc` works!)
- Emscriptem if you want to emulate unix
- Wait for WASI to be a real thing
- Rely on `web-sys` and `wasm-bindgen` as much as possible in the interim

</v-clicks>


<!--
e.g. `use std::path` knows about a `/var/log/hello.log` and `C:\logs\hello.log`. But what is a `Path` in WASM?
WASM gives you enough Assembly to write algorithms, but io/net/threads might be what you expect.

WASM has the ideals of "new native" performance. So how fast really is it?

## Software drag racing 

`sum-reduce.js`

```js
const sumReduce = (to) => {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < to; i++) {
    total += i;
  }
  return total;
}
```

`sum_reduce.rs`

```rust
pub extern "C" fn sum_reduce(to: i64) -> i64 {
    let mut total: i64 = 0;
    for i in 0..=to {
        total += i

**Figma**

**TensorFlow**
